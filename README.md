# Stephen Currie's Web Application Portfolio

## Description

This page is a web portfolio for Stephen Currie.  The look and feel and content of this page will get updated periodically as new applications get built and/or when the page can be improved visually.

The "contact me" form is not working at the moment, but that will get updated shortly.  

The responsiveness will also get improved to display better on various screen sizes.

Stephen can always be reached directly at scurrie@gmail.com
